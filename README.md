# Autism Detection Using Video Classification

ðŸ“œ Project Overview

This project focuses on building an advanced deep learning model capable of detecting autism traits in individuals from video inputs. By analyzing behavioral patterns and facial expressions, the model provides insights that may support early autism diagnosis, offering a potential tool for mental health experts.

ðŸš€ Key Features

    Video-based Classification: Processes video frames to detect autism-related traits.
    Deep Learning Model: Utilizes state-of-the-art neural networks for feature extraction and classification.
    Behavioral Analysis: Evaluates visual cues such as eye contact, body posture, and movement.

    ðŸ›  Tech Stack

    Programming Language: Python
    Libraries: OpenCV, TensorFlow, Keras, NumPy, Matplotlib
    Model Architecture: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
    Preprocessing: Frame extraction, data augmentation, and normalization

    ðŸŽ¯ Business Problem Addressed

Early detection of autism can significantly improve outcomes for individuals by enabling timely interventions. This system was designed to automate the autism detection process, reducing the reliance on extensive manual assessments by healthcare professionals.
